                    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring
                        information—demonstrated
                        by
                        machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by non-human animals and humans. Example tasks in
                        which this
                        is
                        done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as
                        well
                        as other
                        mappings of inputs.
                        <br><br>AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search),
                        recommendation
                        systems
                        (used
                        by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa),
                        self-driving
                        cars
                        (e.g.,
                        Waymo), automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems
                        (such
                        as
                        chess
                        and Go).[1] As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence"
                        are
                        often
                        removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.[2] For instance, optical
                        character
                        recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI,[3] having become a routine
                        technology.[4]
                        <br><br>Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years
                        since has
                        experienced several waves of optimism,[5][6] followed by disappointment and the loss of funding
                        (known as an
                        "AI
                        winter"),[7][8] followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.[6][9] AI research has
                        tried
                        and
                        discarded many different approaches since its founding, including simulating the brain, modeling
                        human
                        problem
                        solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge and imitating animal behavior. In the first
                        decades of
                        the
                        21st century, highly mathematical-statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this
                        technique
                        has
                        proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and
                        academia.[9][10]
                        <br><br>The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use
                        of
                        particular
                        tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation,
                        planning,
                        learning,
                        natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects.[a]
                        General
                        intelligence
                        (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals.[11] To solve
                        these
                        problems,
                        AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques –
                        including
                        search and
                        mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on
                        statistics,
                        probability and economics. AI also draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics,
                        philosophy,
                        and
                        many
                        other fields.
                        <br><br>The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so precisely
                        described that
                        a
                        machine can be made to simulate it".[b] This raised philosophical arguments about the mind and
                        the
                        ethical
                        consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence; these issues
                        have
                        previously
                        been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity.[13] Computer scientists and
                        philosophers have
                        since suggested that AI may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities
                        are
                        not
                        steered
                        towards beneficial goals.[c]

                    <p>Artificial beings with intelligence appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity,[14] and have
                        been
                        common
                        in
                        fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel Čapek's R.U.R.[15] These characters and
                        their
                        fates
                        raised
                        many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence.[16]
                        <br><br>The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians
                        in
                        antiquity.
                        The study of mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which
                        suggested
                        that a
                        machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable act of
                        mathematical
                        deduction. This insight that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning is
                        known
                        as the
                        Church–Turing thesis.[17] This, along with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology, information
                        theory and
                        cybernetics, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain.[18]
                        The
                        first work
                        that is now generally recognized as AI was McCullouch and Pitts' 1943 formal design for
                        Turing-complete
                        "artificial neurons".[19]
                        <br><br>By the 1950s, two visions for how to achieve machine intelligence emerged. One vision,
                        known
                        as
                        Symbolic
                        AI or GOFAI, was to use computers to create a symbolic representation of the world and systems
                        that
                        could
                        reason
                        about the world. Proponents included Allen Newell, Herbert A. Simon, and Marvin Minsky. Closely
                        associated
                        with
                        this approach was the "heuristic search" approach, which likened intelligence to a problem of
                        exploring a
                        space
                        of possibilities for answers. The second vision, known as the connectionist approach, sought to
                        achieve
                        intelligence through learning. Proponents of this approach, most prominently Frank Rosenblatt,
                        sought to
                        connect
                        Perceptron in ways inspired by connections of neurons.[20] James Manyika and others have
                        compared
                        the two
                        approaches to the mind (Symbolic AI) and the brain (connectionist). Manyika argues that symbolic
                        approaches
                        dominated the push for artificial intelligence in this period, due in part to its connection to
                        intellectual
                        traditions of Descarte, Boole, Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, and others. Connectionist
                        approaches
                        based
                        on
                        cybernetics or artificial neural networks were pushed to the background but have gained new
                        prominence in
                        recent
                        decades.[21]
                        <br><br>The field of AI research was born at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956.[d][24] The
                        attendees
                        became the founders and leaders of AI research.[e] They and their students produced programs
                        that
                        the press
                        described as "astonishing":[f] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word
                        problems in
                        algebra,
                        proving logical theorems and speaking English.[g][26] By the middle of the 1960s, research in
                        the
                        U.S. was
                        heavily funded by the Department of Defense[27] and laboratories had been established around the
                        world.[28]
                        <br><br>Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would
                        eventually
                        succeed
                        in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the goal of their
                        field.[29]
                        Herbert Simon predicted, "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man
                        can
                        do".[30]
                        Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, "within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial
                        intelligence'
                        will
                        substantially be solved".[31] They had failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the
                        remaining
                        tasks.
                        Progress slowed and in 1974, in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill[32] and ongoing
                        pressure
                        from
                        the US Congress to fund more productive projects, both the U.S. and British governments cut off
                        exploratory
                        research in AI. The next few years would later be called an "AI winter", a period when obtaining
                        funding for
                        AI
                        projects was difficult.[7]
                        <br><br>In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert
                        systems,[33]
                        a form
                        of
                        AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the
                        market
                        for AI
                        had
                        reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project
                        inspired
                        the
                        U.S.
                        and British governments to restore funding for academic research.[6] However, beginning with the
                        collapse of
                        the
                        Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting
                        winter
                        began.[8]

                        Many researchers began to doubt that the symbolic approach would be able to imitate all the
                        processes of
                        human
                        cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition. A number of
                        researchers began
                        to
                        look into "sub-symbolic" approaches to specific AI problems.[34] Robotics researchers, such as
                        Rodney
                        Brooks,
                        rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to
                        move,
                        survive,
                        and
                        learn their environment.[h] Interest in neural networks and "connectionism" was revived by
                        Geoffrey
                        Hinton,
                        David Rumelhart and others in the middle of the 1980s.[39] Soft computing tools were developed
                        in
                        the 1980s,
                        such as neural networks, fuzzy systems, Grey system theory, evolutionary computation and many
                        tools
                        drawn
                        from
                        statistics or mathematical optimization.
                        <br><br>AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by finding
                        specific
                        solutions to specific problems. The narrow focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable
                        results,
                        exploit
                        more
                        mathematical methods, and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and
                        mathematics).[40]
                        By
                        2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they
                        were
                        rarely
                        described as "artificial intelligence".[10]

                        Faster computers, algorithmic improvements, and access to large amounts of data enabled advances
                        in
                        machine
                        learning and perception; data-hungry deep learning methods started to dominate accuracy
                        benchmarks
                        around
                        2012.[41] According to Bloomberg's Jack Clark, 2015 was a landmark year for artificial
                        intelligence,
                        with
                        the
                        number of software projects that use AI within Google increased from a "sporadic usage" in 2012
                        to
                        more than
                        2,700 projects.[i] He attributes this to an increase in affordable neural networks, due to a
                        rise in
                        cloud
                        computing infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets.[9] In a 2017 survey,
                        one
                        in five
                        companies reported they had "incorporated AI in some offerings or processes".[42] The amount of
                        research
                        into AI
                        (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019.[43]

                        Numerous academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing the original goal
                        of
                        creating
                        versatile, fully intelligent machines. Much of current research involves statistical AI, which
                        is
                        overwhelmingly
                        used to solve specific problems, even highly successful techniques such as deep learning. This
                        concern has
                        led
                        to the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or "AGI"), which had several well-funded
                        institutions by
                        the
                        2010s.[11]
